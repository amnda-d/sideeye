"""
This is an example of how to use the SideEye module in a simple way. It takes a
directory of DA1 files (examples/sample_DA1s), a region file (examples/sample.cnt),
and a config file (examples/sample_config.json) as input. The DA1 files are parsed
into a list SideEye experiment objects, and all measures specified in the config
file are calculated and output as a csv file (examples/sample_output.csv).

To run: Copy this file and sample_config.json into a directory containing a
region file and a directory of DA1 files. Edit the file names below to match your files,
and make any necessary changes to the config file. Run sample.py in the new directory.
