Introduction
============

SideEye is a Python package for processing data from eye-tracking while reading experiments. The package contains parsers that accept fixation data in .DA1 file format, and region definitions in several formats. SideEye calculates eye-tracking measures for parsed data, and can write output in .csv format.
