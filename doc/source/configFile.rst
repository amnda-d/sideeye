The Configuration File
======================

.. contents::

The configuration file is a JSON file specifying the parameters used by SideEye's parsing and output functions. There is a :doc:`default configuration <default_config.json>` used by SideEye if a custom configuration is not provided.
A custom configuration file must contain the same fields as the default configuration file. To use a custom configuration, copy :doc:`default_config.json <default_config.json>`, change values to your configuration, and provide the file name in functions requiring a configuration in your code.

The sections of the config file are:

``wide_format``: Whether the output file should be in wide or long format.

``da1_fields``: The locations of values in each line of a .DA1 file.

``region_fields``: The locations of values in each line of a region file.

``cutoffs``: Fixation duration cutoffs.

``region_measures``: Used in region measure calculation and output.

``trial_measures``: Used in trial measure calculation and output.

``region_output``: Reported columns for region measures in output file.

``trial_output``: Reported columns for trial measures in output file.

``terminal_output``: Amount of status/debugging information to output to terminal.

wide_format
~~~~~~~~~~~

A boolean (``true/false``) indicating whether the output should be in wide or long format. If ``true``, the output will be in wide format, with each measure as a column of the csv. If ``false``, the output will be in long format, with each measure as a separate row of the csv.

For example, the column headers in long format will be:

::

  experiment_name,trial_id,trial_total_time,item_id,item_condition,region_number,measure,value

The column headers in wide format will be:

::
  experiment_name,trial_id,trial_total_time,item_id,item_condition,region_number,skip,first_pass_regressions_out, ... ,average_forward_saccade,average_backward_saccade

da1_fields
~~~~~~~~~~

This section contains parameters needed for parsing .DA1 files. A .DA1 file describes the position and timing of fixations. Each line of the file represents a single trial in an experiment. The first fields in the line contain information identifying the trial. After these fields, fixations are represented by groups of four numbers - x-position, y-position, start time, and end time. Five fields are necessary for parsing a .DA1 file:

``index``: An integer identifying a single trial, usually the first number in the line.

``condition``: A value identifying the condition of the trial.

``number``: A value identifying the item of the trial.

``time``: The total time of a trial, sometimes either not included in DA1 files or at the end of every line. If this is true, this parameter should be ``-1``.

``fixation_start``: The position in a line where fixation data starts.

The default configuration for .DA1 files is:

::

  "da1_fields" : {
    "index": 0,
    "condition": 1,
    "number": 2,
    "time": -1,
    "fixation_start": 8
  }

This default configuration matches a .DA1 file with the following format:

::

  Position:   0   |   1   |   2   | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 |   8   |   9   | ... |  -1  |
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Value:    index | cond. | num.  |   |   |   |   |   | fix.  | fix.  | ... | time |

region_fields
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Similar to ``da1_fields``, this section specifies the positions of values in each line of a region file. Region files (typically .cnt or .reg) describe regions of interest in items of the experiment. Regions are defined by a character position of the beginning and ending of the region. Character positions can either be a single integer for single-line items, or a pair (line, character) of integers for multi-line items. A line in a region file contains the number and condition of an item, followed by the beginning and end positions of the regions. Four fields are necessary for parsing a region file.

``number``: Item identifier.

``condition``: Item condition.

``boundaries_start``: The position where region boundaries start in a line.

``includes_y``: True for multi-line items where regions are bounded by character and line position pairs, false for single-line items where regions are bounded by single integer character positions.

The default configuration for region files is:

::

  "region_fields": {
    "number": 0,
    "condition": 1,
    "boundaries_start": 3,
    "includes_y": false
  }

The default configuration matches a region file with the following format:

::

  Position:   0   |   1   | 2 |   3   |   4   |   5   |   6   | ... |
  -------------------------------------------------------------------
  Value:    num.  | cond. |   |  r1   |  r1   |  r2   |  r2   | ... |

cutoffs
~~~~~~~

This section contains cutoffs for fixations. If a fixation's duration is less than `min` or greater than `max`, it will be excluded from measure calculations. `include_fixation` and `include_saccades` describe how excluded fixations should be handled when calculating saccades. For more information, see the examples in :ref:`Trials <Trial>`.

``min``: Minimum cutoff time for fixation duration.

``max``: Maximum cutoff time for fixation duration.

``include_fixation``: When true, if a fixation is excluded by cutoffs, its duration is included in the duration of the saccade between the previous and next non-excluded fixations.

``include_saccades``: When true, if a fixation is excluded by cutoffs, the duration of the saccade into and out of the fixation is included in the saccade between the previous and next non-excluded fixations.

region_measures
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section contains parameters for region measure calculation and output. It is a list of all calculated region measure, each with two parameters:

``cutoff``: A cutoff value for the measure. If the calculated measure is greater than this value, its value in the output report is ``CUTOFF``. For some measures, where the value is not numerical, this parameter is ignored.

``include``: A boolean (true/false) value specifying whether the measure should be included in the output report. If false, the measure will be excluded.

``header``: A string used as a header for the measure in wide output format.

The measures in this section of the config file are:

::

  skip
  first_pass_regressions_out
  first_pass_regressions_in
  first_fixation_duration
  single_fixation_duration
  first_pass
  go_past
  total_time
  right_bounded_time
  reread_time
  second_pass
  spillover_time
  refixation_time
  landing_position
  launch_site
  first_pass_fixation_count
  go_back_time_region
  go_back_time_char

trial_measures
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section contains parameters for trial measure calculation and output. Each measure has the same parameters as ``region_measures``. The measures included in this section are:

::

  location_first_regression
  latency_first_regression
  fixation_count
  percent_regressions
  trial_total_time
  average_forward_saccade
  average_backward_saccade

region_output
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section specifies the columns that should be included in the output file for region measures. Each output column has two parameters:

``include``: Whether or not the column should be included in the output report, true or false.

``header``: A title for the header of the column. Can be different from the name of the column parameter.

Columns included in this section are:

``experiment_name``: Name of experiment.

``filename``: Filename of DA1 file.

``date``: Date of DA1 file if specified, or date file was parsed if not.

``trial_id``: Trial identifier.

``trial_total_time``: Total time of trial.

``item_id``: Item identifier.

``item_condition``: Condition of item.

``region_label``: Label for region.

``region_number``: Region number (beginning with 0).

``region_text``: Text included in region, if specified.

``region_start``: Character location of beginning of region.

``region_end``: Character location of end of region.

trial_output
~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section specifies the columns that should be included in the output file for trial measures. Each column has the same parameters as ``region_output``. The columns are the same, but with columns beginning with ``region_`` excluded.

terminal_output
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A number specifying the level of detail in terminal output. This option is useful for debugging, for example, finding out if an error is being caused by a specific input file, or by calculating a specific measure.

``0``: Errors only.

``1``: File-level information (which file is currently being parsed).

``2``: Item and trial-level parsing information.

``3``: Measure-level calculation information.

``4``: Trial-level calculation information.

``5``: All output information.
