"""
A Fixation represents a period of time where a participant fixated on an item
in a trial. Fixation position is represented by character and line position in
the item. A Fixation can also hold information about the region of the item it
occurred in, and whether or not it has been excluded by fixation cutoff
parameters. If the x or y position of the fixation is -1, the fixation is excluded.

class Fixation:
    """
    Represents a single Fixation by location, start time, and end time.

    Attributes:
        char (Optional[int]): Character position of the fixation. None of position
                            is negative.
        line (Optional[int]): Line position of the fixation. None if position is
                            negative.
        duration (int): Total time of Fixation (end - start) in milliseconds.
        start (int): Start time of Fixation in milliseconds since trial start.
        end (int): End time of Fixation in milliseconds since trial start.
        index (int): Index of where the Fixation occurred in a trial.
        region (Region): Region the Fixation occurred in.
        excluded (bool): Whether or not the fixation will be excluded from calculations.

    Args:
        position (Point): The character and line position of the Fixation, zero-indexed.
        start (int): Start time for the Fixation, in milliseconds.
        end (int): End time for the Fixation, in milliseconds.
        index (int): An index of where the fixation occurred in a trial.
        region (Region): Region the Fixation occurs in.
        excluded (Optional[boolean]): Whether the fixation should be excluded from calculations.
